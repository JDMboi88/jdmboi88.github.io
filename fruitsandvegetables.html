                    Fruits are a big part of most people's diets being both a tasty treat and a healthy snack.<br />
                    Fruiting plants come in all shapes and sizes from large trees so small individual plants that can be kept in pots. <br />
                    What you decide to grow will depend on the space that you have available as well as what you would like to eat. <br />
                    There is a lot of variety to choose from from something as small as a strawberry to something as big as a papaya.

                    Vegetables are different from fruits in the sense that they are not necessarily used as nacks but more as cooking ingredients <br />
                    Vegetables also grow differently from fruits as they're usually individual plants and not something that is grown as a fruit <br />
                    The dilema of what to grow is the same as with fruits. It is all up to your available space as well as the space you have availale <br />
                    Luckily most vegetables don't need much space and can be grown in pots.
