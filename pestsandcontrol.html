                    The damage that pests can cause varies on the variety of pest in question. Most eat the plants or fruit directly but some are more discreet. <br />
                    Diseases in plants can be caused by either bacteria spread by insects or by fungus which attacks a vital part of a plant. <br />
                    Probably the worst kind of disease that affects gardens is fungi which can range from mildew to black spot disease. <br />
