                    Pollinators are creatures that visit flowers to feed on nectar. During feeding they carry pollen from one flower to another which greatly helps the plant <br />
                    They can be anything from insects such as bees to animals such as hummingbirds. They are incredibly helpful to gardens since they help <br />
                    them thrive and help increase fruit yields in many cases.

                    Pollinators will be most attracted to your garden if you have a source of food for them. As such a lot of flowers and flowering plants <br />
                    will help attract them. This applies to most pollinators but helps out a lot with bees and butterflies. Hummingbirds will be attracted to flowers <br />
                    of course but a well placed feeder will help keep them coming to your garden to visit not only the feeder but the other plants in your garden. <br />
                    Once they see your garden as a source of food they will consistnetly visit.
